your fingertips across my skin



in my chain

you 

the sweetest 

I never want to see you unhappy

I thought you were the same for me 



good bye my almost lover

good bye my hopeless dream

I'm trying not to think about you

can't u just let me be 

so long my luckless romance

my back is turn on you

should I know you bring me heartache

almost lovers always do



we walked along across in the street

imaging 

and when u left you kissed my leck



I never want to see you unhappy

I thought you will the same for me 

I'm trying not to think about you



 I cannot go to the ocean
